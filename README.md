# MixUW App UI Prototype
![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

UI prototype for a University of Washington community app to bridge social divides.
I worked in a team of five students to perform user research and design the prototype using UI principles.

⭐ Among 5 projects of 61 to be selected Best Project in UW INFO200 Spring 2020.

## About
According to the Spring 2020 enrollment statistics from the University of Washington,
nearly 40% of the total student population is from out-of-state and international regions
(University of Washington Registrar, 2020, p.1). Such a diverse student demographic
offers the potential for a rich, intercultural experience at the UW intended to reflect today’s
society, but beneath it all lies great social challenges that must be considered as well.
While studying at the UW, our team has noticed how difficult it is for our non-local
colleagues to adjust to the surrounding culture and forge friendships with local students
like us. Not only does it result in feelings of resentment, isolation, discouragement, and
loneliness in out-of-state students, but it ultimately lends itself to a greater culture of
xenophobia and discrimination. A notable example of this is the way Chinese students at
the UW have experienced aggressions stemming from the recent COVID-19 outbreak,
underscoring the widespread xenophobia that continues to endure in universities. Our
final project aims to explore technological solutions for mitigating the social and cultural
gaps between domestic and international students at the University of Washington.

We propose a social app called “MixUW”, which is a play on the term ‘mix-up’. The app’s
objective is to mix cultural groups at the University of Washington. MixUW features both
groups and messaging components as well as a community feed component. At the
launch screen, students log in with their UW NetID, which serves as verification that the
student is from the school. After they log in, students would be able to specify their
nationality, native language, major, year, and their interests, allowing the app to place
them in relevant groups and community feeds. The app would then match the student
with others from different cultures, with a combination of both local and non-local
students, and that may share related interests.

From there, the out-of-state and local students can chat with and get to know one
another in the chat group. The local student would be able to help out-of-state students
become more familiar with the school and Seattle culture and can help answer any
questions they have, and the non-local student can share about their home culture as
well. In the feed component, the feed would resemble Reddit where the feed will be
relevant to the student’s interests, as well as give students the option to ask general
questions about things such as American culture, if they are looking for a study group, or
if they need advice navigating the surrounding area. MixUW has the potential to improve
students’ self-esteem, promote intercultural friendships, and foster open-mindedness and
greater cultural awareness among the University of Washington students overall.
